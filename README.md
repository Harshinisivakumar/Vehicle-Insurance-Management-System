**Vehicle Insurance Management System **
The Vehicle Insurance Management System is a web-based application developed using Python Django for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. 
It is designed to manage and streamline vehicle insurance-related operations for users and administrators.

**Frontend (HTML/CSS):**
Provides user-friendly interfaces for policyholders and admins to interact with the systemâ€”such as forms to submit vehicle details, view policy status,
and make payments.

**Backend (Django):**
Handles core functionalities like user authentication, CRUD operations for policies and vehicles, insurance tracking, premium payments,
reminders, and report generation. The database (typically SQLite or PostgreSQL) stores all insurance, customer, and vehicle-related data securely.

Key Features:
*User Registration & Login
*Manage Vehicle and Policy Details
*Add, Edit, View, and Delete Insurance Records
*Policy Expiry Reminders
*Payment Tracking (with optional integration like Razorpay)
*Admin Dashboard for Monitoring and Control

**Use Case:**
Useful for insurance agencies, brokers, and customers to manage different types of vehicle insurance like Comprehensive, Third-Party, Own Damage, etc.,
across various vehicle types (2-wheeler to 9-wheeler).
